Although provision was made in the APRS SPEC for new formats for 
experimentation and special use applications, this experimental
escape sequence should not be used for applications where broad user
receipt or backwards compatibility is needed.  Remember, that as of
June 2004, almost 55% of packet stations on the air were using
FIXED firmware (radios) that may not be easily upgraded.

Therefore, authors are encouraged to try to use MESSAGE, STATUS or 
POSIION comment field formats for these special uses where possible 
to maintain backwards compatibility with old systems.  

The following experimental formats have been reserved:
