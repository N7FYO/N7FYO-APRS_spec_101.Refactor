>> Picking up this old thread; was a sub-specification for working PM2.5 data into the APRS stream ever worked out? I have one in operation and would like to make that data available on CWOP/APRS (not necessarily via RF).

No one ever did. The first guy to put one on the air gets to define the format. I would suggest one that includes the three major AQ measurements (2.5 and 10 nm particulates and ozone) even if you don't put them all on the air so another format is not needed in the future, allowing for absent measurements to be replaced with dots, as in the weather format. The User Defined list is here, 

http://www.aprs.org/aprs11/expfmts.txt

simply pick an unused character pair to follow the {.

If anyone wants to start a discussion, my opening suggestion would be

{AQ PM2.5 x.x PM10 y.y ozn z.z

and allowing any float or integer value, not position limited, so just a 2.5 report might look like 

K4HG>APRS:{AQ PM2.5 12.5 PM10 ... ozn ...

Any discussion?

>> This project uses the SDS011 particulate sensor. Looking at its specs it would be trivial to interface (rs232 output) but if the specs are accurate it isn't designed for outside air. It is rated for storage in up to 90% humidity and operation in up to 70% humidity. Not too many places in the world are consistently under 70%. It draws air in with a fan and my guess is water would precipitate from humid air inside the sensor. Maybe heating the unit would prevent that.
