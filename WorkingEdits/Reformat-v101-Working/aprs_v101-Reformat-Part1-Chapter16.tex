\chapter{Chapter 16: Status Reports}


A Status Report announces the station’s current mission or any other single
line status to everyone. The report is contained in the AX.25 Information
field, and starts with the > APRS Data Type Identifier.
The report may optionally contain a timestamp.

Note: The timestamp can only be in DHM zulu format.

The status text occupies the rest of the Information field, and may be up to 62
characters long (if there is no timestamp in the report) or 55 characters (if
there is a timestamp). The text may contain any printable ASCII characters
except | or ~.
