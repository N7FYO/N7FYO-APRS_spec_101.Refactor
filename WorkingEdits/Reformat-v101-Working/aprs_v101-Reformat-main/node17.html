Authors’ Foreword</A>
</H1>

<P>
This reference document describes what is known as APRS Protocol
Version 1.0, and is essentially a description of how APRS operates
today.  It is intended primarily for the programmer who wishes to
develop APRS compliant applications, but will also be of interest to
the ordinary user who wants to know more about what goes on “under the
hood”.  It is not intended, however, to be a dry-as-dust, pedantic,
RFC-style programming specification, to be read and understood only by
the Mr Spocks of this world. We have included many items of general
information which, although strictly not part of the formal protocol
description, provide a useful background on how APRS is actually used
on the air, and how it is implemented in APRS software. We hope this
will put APRS into perspective, will make the document more readable,
and will not offend the purists too much.

<P>
It is important to realize how APRS originated, and to understand the
design philosophy behind it. In particular, we feel strongly that APRS
is, and should remain, a light-weight tactical system — almost anyone
should be able to use it in temporary situations (such as emergencies
or mobile work or weather watching) with the minimum of training and
equipment.

<P>
This document is the result of inputs from many people, and collated
and massaged by the APRS Working Group. Our sincere thanks go to
everyone who has contributed in putting it together and getting it
onto the street. If you discover any errors or omissions or misleading
statements, please let us know — the best way to do this is via the
TAPR aprsspec mailing list at www.tapr.org.

<P>
Finally, users throughout the world are continually coming up with new
ideas and suggestions for extending and improving APRS. We welcome
them.  Again, the best way to discuss these is via the aprsspec list.

<P>
&ndash;The APRS Working Group, August 2000
