APRS Features</A>
</H1>

<P>
APRS runs on most platforms, including DOS, Windows 3.x, Windows
95/98, MacOS, Linux and Palm. Most implementations on these platforms
support the main features of APRS:

<P>

<UL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Maps &ndash;</SPAN>APRS station positions can be plotted in real-time on maps,
with coverage from a few hundred yards to worldwide. Stations reporting
a course and speed are dead-reckoned to their present position. Overlay
databases of the locations of APRS digipeaters, US National Weather
Service sites and even amateur radio stores are available. It is possible to
zoom in to any point on the globe.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Weather Station Reporting &ndash;</SPAN> APRS supports the automatic display of
remote weather station information on the screen.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">DX Cluster Reporting &ndash;</SPAN> APRS an ideal tool for the DX cluster user.
Small numbers of APRS stations connected to DX clusters can relay DX
station information to many other stations in the local area, reducing
overall packet load on the clusters.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Internet Access &ndash;</SPAN> The Internet can be used transparently to cross-link
local radio nets anywhere on the globe. It is possible to telnet into
Internet APRS servers and see hundreds of stations from all over the
world live. Everyone connected can feed their locally heard packets into
the APRS server system and everyone everywhere can see them.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Messages &ndash;</SPAN> Messages are two-way messages with acknowledgement.
All incoming messages alert the user on arrival and are held on the
message screen until killed.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Bulletins and Announcements &ndash;</SPAN> Bulletins and announcements are
addressed to everyone. Bulletins are sent a few times an hour for a few
hours, and announcements less frequently but possibly over a few days.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Fixed Station Tracking &ndash;</SPAN> In addition to automatically tracking mobile
GPS/LORAN-equipped stations, APRS also tracks from manual reports
or grid squares.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Objects &ndash;</SPAN> Any user can place an APRS Object on his own map, and
within seconds that object appears on all other station displays. This is
particularly useful for tracking assets or people that are not equipped
with trackers. Only one packet operator needs to know where things are
(e.g. by monitoring voice traffic), and as he maintains the positions and
movements of assets on his screen, all other stations running APRS will
display the same information.
