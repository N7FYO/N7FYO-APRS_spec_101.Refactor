Net Cycle Time</A>
</H1>

<P>
It is important to note that APRS is primarily a real-time, tactical
communications tool, to help the flow of information for things like special
events, emergencies, Skywarn, the Emergency Operations Center and just
plain in-the-field use under stress. But like the real world, for 99% of the
time it is operating routinely, waiting for the unlikely serious event to
happen.

<P>
Anything which is done to enhance APRS must not undermine its ability to
operate in local areas under stress. Here are the details of that philosophy:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>APRS uses the concept of a “net cycle time”. This is the time within
which a user should be able to hear (at least once) all APRS stations
within range, to obtain a more or less complete picture of APRS activity.
The net cycle time will vary according to local conditions and with the
number of digipeaters through which APRS data travels.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The objective is to have a net cycle time of 10 minutes for local use. This
means that within 10 minutes of arrival on the scene, it is possible to
captured the entire tactical picture.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>All stations, even fixed stations, should beacon their position at the net
cycle time rate. In a stress situation, stations are coming and going all the
time. The position reports show not only where stations are without
asking, but also that they are still active.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>It is not reasonable to assume that all APRS users responding to a stress
event understand the ramifications of APRS and the statistics of the
channel — user settings cannot be relied on to avoid killing a stressed
net. Thus, to try to anticipate when the channel is under stress, APRS
automatically adjusts its net cycle time according to the number of
digipeaters in the UNPROTO path:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Direct operation (no digipeaters): 10 minutes (probably an
event).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Via one digipeater hop: 10 minutes (probably an event).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Via two digipeater hops: 20 minutes.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Via three or more digipeater hops: 30 minutes.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Since almost all home stations set their paths to three or more
digipeaters, the default net cycle time for routine daily operation is
30 minutes. This should be a universal standard that everyone can bank
on &ndash; if you routinely turn on your radio and APRS and do nothing
else, then in 30 minutes you should have virtually the total picture
of all APRS stations within range.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Since knowing where the digipeaters are located is fundamental to APRS
connectivity, digipeaters should use multiple beacon commands to
transmit position reports at different rates over different paths; i.e. every
10 minutes for sending position reports locally, and every 30 minutes for
sending them via three digipeaters (plus others rates and distances as
needed).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>If the net cycle time is too long, users will be tempted to send queries for
APRS stations. This will increase the traffic on the channel
unnecessarily. Thus the recommended extremes for net cycle time are 10
and 30 minutes — this gives network designers the fundamental
assumptions for channel loading necessary for good engineering design.

<P>
</LI>
</OL>
